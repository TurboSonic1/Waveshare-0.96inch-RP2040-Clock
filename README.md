# Waveshare-0.96inch-RP2040-Clock
Just a simple clock that you can set manually that's pretty accurate without relying on ntp or other libraries.

Â±5-20ms precision at time you'll see it skip a second from it catching up from slow execution but it'll keep that level of precision even after slow execution
