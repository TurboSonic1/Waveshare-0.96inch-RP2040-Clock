# Waveshare-0.96inch-RP2040-Clock
Just a simple clock that you can set manually that's pretty accurate without relying on ntp or other libraries.

The date is in M/D/Y format for 0.96 inch screens and displays in 24 hour time

±5-20ms precision every second. you'll see it skip a second from it catching up from slow execution but it'll keep that level of precision even after slow execution. about 1 second time drift every 24 hours
